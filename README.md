# World_Weather_Analysis

## Project Overview 
The purpose of this project is to equip the app "PlanMyTrip" with the analytical intelligence to recommend ideal hotels based upon client's weather preferences. In order to do so we will use Pandaâ€™s Data Frames, Jupyter Notebook, as well as Google API to collect and analyze this data. The final output will be an app that allows users to select their specific weather preferences and in turn potential travel destinations and hotels are promoted. The last feature will allow the user to create a travel itinerary using Google Maps Directions API, which will allow the user to create a travel route between multiple cities.
